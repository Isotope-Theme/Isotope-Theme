## About the Project

This is my contribution to the overabundance of color schemes. I was bothered by
the lack of compatibility for color schemes, with all of the programs that I
use. I really liked the concepts of
[baser](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), But I wanted to have the
availability of more colors, so that there are dark, normal, and light variants
for the colors.

So I created this project, which uses a few common palette files, and a
generator to construct the themes for a number of different tools. Each
repository also has an automated installer script, which implements all of the
necessary steps to install the theme for that tool.

To preserve consistency, I have also begun to develop a specification for the
colors, specifically how they should be used for different syntax groups, and UI 
uses.
